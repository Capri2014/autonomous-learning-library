Getting Started
===============

Prerequisites
-------------

The Autonomous Learning Library requires a recent version of Pytorch (>= 10.3).
Additionally, Tensorboard is required in order to enable logging.
We recommond installing these through `Conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`_.
We also strongly recommend using a machine with a fast GPU (a GTX 970 or better).

Installation
------------

The ``autonomous-learning-library`` can be installed from PyPi using ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install autonomous-learning-library

If you don't have PyTorch or Tensorboard previously installed, you can install them using:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install autonomous-learning-library[pytorch]

An alternate approach, that may be useful when following this tutorial, is to instead install by cloning the Github repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/cpnota/autonomous-learning-library.git
    cd autonomous-learning-library
    pip install -e .["dev"]

If you chose to clone the repository, you can test your installation by running the unit test suite:

.. code-block:: bash

    make test

This should also tell you if CUDA (the GPU driver) is available.

Running a Preset Agent
----------------------

The goal of the Autonomous Learning Library is to provide components for building new agents.
However, the library also includes a number of "preset" agent configurations for easy benchmarking and comparison,
as well as some useful scripts.
For example, an A2C agent can be run on Cart-Pole as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    all-classic CartPole-v0 ppo

The results will be written to ``runs/_a2c <id>``, where ``<id>`` is some some string generated by the library.
You can view these results and other information through `tensorboard`:

.. code-block:: bash

    tensorboard --logdir runs

By opening your browser to <http://localhost:6006>, you should see a dashboard that looks something like the following (you may need to adjust the "smoothing" parameter):

.. image:: tensorboard.png

If you want to compare agents in a nicer, format, you can use the `plot` script:

.. code-block:: bash

    all-plot --logdir runs

This should give you a plot similar to the following:

.. image:: plot.png

In this plot, each point represents the average of the episodic returns over the last 100 episodes.
The shaded region represents the standard deviation over that interval.

Finally, to watch the trained model in action, we provide a `watch` scripts for each preset module:

.. code-block:: bash

   all-watch-classic CartPole-v0 "runs/_a2c <id>"

You need to find the <id> by checking the ``runs`` directory.

Each of these scripts can be found the ``scripts`` directory of the main repository.
Be sure to check out the ``atari`` and ``continuous`` scripts for more fun!
